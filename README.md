# Smart Contract Toolkit 

This repository focuses on the extraction of features from smart contract bytecode/source code for the purpose of vulnerability/malicious detection.

### SC Specialized Programming Languages
* [Clarity](https://clarity-lang.org/) - Clarity brings smart contracts to Bitcoin. It is a decidable language, meaning you can know, with certainty, from the code itself what the program will do. Clarity is interpreted (not compiled) & the source code is published on the blockchain. Clarity gives developers a safe way to build complex smart contracts for the world's most secure blockchain.
* [Solidity](https://soliditylang.org/) - A statically-typed curly-braces programming language designed for developing smart contracts that run on Ethereum.
* [Vyper](https://vyperlang.org/) - Vyper is a smart contract language with a relentless focus on security, simplicity, and readability. It empowers developers to write clean, auditable, and gas-efficient code for the EVM, without common pitfalls.
